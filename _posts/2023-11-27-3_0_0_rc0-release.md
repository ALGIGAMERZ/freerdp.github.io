FreeRDP 3.0.0-rc0 has just been released and uploaded to

[https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/)


3.0.0-rc0 is first release candidate for a new major release. Nearly 2 months of testing, bugfixing and API refinements after the last beta release this marks the current API as stable.
Only minor changes (if at all) are expected from this point on, so every project using FreeRDP can check compatibility with upcoming 3.0
