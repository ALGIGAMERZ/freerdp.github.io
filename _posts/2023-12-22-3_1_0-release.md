FreeRDP 3.1.0 has just been released and uploaded to

[https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/)

A new 3.1.0 minor release for the new 3.0.0 series.
This contains bugfixes, adds (better) support for libressl and mbedtls and
brings a bunch of improvements for the SDL client.

Since there are multiple new features, some new files (man pages) and new
optional dependencies weÂ´ve directly incremented the minor version
