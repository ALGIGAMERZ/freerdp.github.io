FreeRDP 3.3.0 has just been released and uploaded to

[https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/)

A new 3.3.0 minor release for the new 3.0.0 series.
This contains bugfixes, some code refinements, better image clipboard support and again
brings a bunch of improvements for the SDL client.

Since there are multiple new features, some new files (man pages) and new
optional dependencies weÂ´ve incremented the minor version again.

See our ChangeLog for a complete list of changes [https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/blob/3.3.0/ChangeLog](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/blob/3.3.0/ChangeLog)
