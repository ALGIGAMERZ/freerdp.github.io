FreeRDP 3.4.0 has just been released and uploaded to

[https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/)

A new 3.4.0 minor release for the new 3.0.0 series.
This release concentrates on improving test coverage and ci builds.
 Some usability issues and inconvenient API functions were fixed on the way.

 New features have been introduced (stub for location channel)

Since there are new API functions weÂ´ve incremented the minor version again.
