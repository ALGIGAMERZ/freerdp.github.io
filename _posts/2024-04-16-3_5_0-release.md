FreeRDP 3.5.0 has just been released and uploaded to

[https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/)

A new 3.5.0 minor release for the new 3.0.0 series.

This release focus is on squashing bugs.
The improved test coverage and ci builds revealed a number of previously
unnoticed issues we have addressed and we also got a report from
Evgeny Legerov of Kaspersky Lab identifying a number of out of bound reads
in decoder components and one very nasty out of bound write.

CVE:
 CVE-2024-32041 [Low[ OutOfBound Read in zgfx_decompress_segment
 CVE-2024-32039 [Moderate] Integer overflow & OutOfBound Write in clear_decompress_residual_data
 CVE-2024-32040 [Low] integer underflow in nsc_rle_decode
 CVE-2024-32458 [Low] OutOfBound Read in planar_skip_plane_rle
 CVE-2024-32459 [Low] OutOfBound Read in ncrush_decompress
 CVE-2024-32460 [Low] OutOfBound Read in interleaved_decompress

Since there are new API functions weÂ´ve incremented the minor version again.
