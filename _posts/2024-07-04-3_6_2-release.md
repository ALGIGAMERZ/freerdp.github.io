FreeRDP 3.6.2 has just been released and uploaded to

[https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/)

Due to some bugs found during release tests 3.6.0 and 3.6.1 have not been released and only 3.6.2 should be uses.


## What's Changed
With this release we did improve decoder speed so you should notice a significant
speed improvement with progressive and other gfx codecs.
We've also eliminated a couple of issues along the way, so an update
is highly recommended.

Noteworthy changes:
* Fix xfreerdp and sdl-freerdp manpage names (accidentally changed name)
* Fix crash of wfreerdp
* Fix missing dependency for ci abi-checker
* Fix build WITH_SSE2/WITH_NEON: only enable support if the compiler
  also defines symbols that suggest support.
