FreeRDP 3.7.0 has just been released and uploaded to

[https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/)

This release has accumulated quite a number of changes. Along bugfixes for 3.6.3 it also
 contains a number of improvements for distributors:

 * Support for FDK-AAC for sound and microphone redirection (activate with -DWITH_FDK_AAC=ON build option)
   This allows enabling the AAC compression that do not ship faad2 and/or faac
 * Support keyboard layouts as JSON resources (activate with -DWITH_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT_FROM_FILE=ON build option,
   also requires JSON support)
   This allows editing keyboard layouts for existing releases should the need arise
 * Support timezones as JSON resources (activate with -DWITH_TIMEZONE_FROM_FILE=ON -DWITH_TIMEZONE_COMPILED=OFF build options,
   also requires JSON support)
   Allows reading the mapping between IANA and windows timezones from a JSON file, allowing easier updates without recompile
 * Improve shadow server compatibility with windows 11 24H2 RDP client
   Windows 7 RFX and bitmap updates with multiple rectangles have been deactivated, so adjust shadow to not send such.
