FreeRDP 3.9.0 has just been released and uploaded to

[https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/)

 We're proud to present the newest release of FreeRDP.
 This one brings some major code cleanup (we've addressed lots of clang-tidy
 warnings) as well as some highly anticipated new features.
 We also did update the API documentation quite a bit (still incomplete though,
 help always welcome ;))

## So, what is new:
 * Support for RDPEAR (remote credential guard) /remoteGuard option for non windows clients
 * Global configuration file support, allowing to configure certificate
   accept/ignore/... default settings for all users
 * Simplified manpage generation, eliminates docbook and xmlto dependencies
   speeding up builds
 * New API for client channels to run tasks on RDP thread
 * New extended transport layer API
 * RDPECAM MJPEG support
 * the first updates of timezone definitions from our automated ci

## Noteworthy changes:
 * Fix bugs in SSE4.1/AVX2 image copy (#10720)
 * Add warnings for invalid monitor settings during connect (#10672)
 * Fix ALSA microphone support (#10664)
 * Fix modal windows in RAILS mode (#10629)
 * Update experimental SDL3 client (SDL3 API should now have been stabilized,
   various pull requests)
 * Fix keyboard layouts, the external JSON did miss a few (#10639)
